//! **A changed validator key on the second boot** (W-N5-06).
//!
//! The row: `--validator-private-key-path` may point at a different file on the next boot, and the
//! resolver holds no persistence — so the node comes up under a new signing identity over a data
//! directory whose chain was built by the old one, and *nothing says so*. The falsifier it asks for is
//! "a test that a second boot with a changed key file either refuses or emits a loud identity-change
//! record"; this is that test, and what it reads is the absence of both.
//!
//! Why it matters: the identity a node signs with is the one thing about it that consensus cares about,
//! and swapping it silently is indistinguishable from an operator pointing a node at the wrong data
//! directory — the class the `shard-id` and `store-format` markers already refuse for two *other*
//! facts about a data directory (`node/src/runtime/node_runtime.rs`). No such marker exists for the
//! validator identity.
