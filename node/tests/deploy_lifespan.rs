//! **A lone dev-mode validator: what it produces on a deploy, and what it finalises** (issue #356).
//!
//! The playground is one dev-mode validator that proposes **on a deploy** and never on a timer
//! (`--propose-on-deploy`, no autopropose). A deploy arrives, the API answers `Success!`, and nothing
//! moves — while on the pre-upgrade binary the same deploy produced a block and finality advanced.
//!
//! Measured on the current build (2026-10-15); this file is the deterministic part of it.
//!
//! * **Production works**: a deploy anchored where the chain is produces a block, with no extra flags
//!   (`a_fresh_single_validator_chain_produces_on_a_deploy_without_extra_flags`). So n=1 is not itself
//!   the defect.
//! * **Finality does not follow it**, in that configuration, and the reason is a *trigger* rather than
//!   a rule: a round closes when a propose carries the attestation, and with autopropose off the only
//!   triggers are the deploy path and the not-due retry — which arms only on `NotEnoughNewBlocks`
//!   (`node/src/instances/proposer_instance.rs::not_due`), never after a propose that produced a
//!   block. `--attest-on-new-blocks` is a third, separate opt-in and is also off. So the fringe stays
//!   one short of the block: the shape the tree's own C209 note records from a live net ("the fringe
//!   stopped one layer short of the deploy").
//! * **With autopropose**, the same node produces *and* finalises
//!   (`a_lone_validator_with_autopropose_produces_and_finalises`). That is the configuration
//!   `tools/devnet.sh` ships with, and the one a lone chain wants.
//!
//! **A third behaviour was measured and is recorded here rather than asserted**, because the fixture
//! that reaches it has to mine fifty heights and a round-gate step in that ladder occasionally takes
//! longer than any bound a test can put on it — and an intermittent test in this repository has cost a
//! CI cycle twice already. On a chain mined past `DEPLOY_LIFESPAN`, with the fringe settled past every
//! deploy-bearing block:
//!
//! ```text
//! settled at h=55, pool=0
//! stale deploy on a settled chain: h 55 -> 55, pool=1, status={"NotProcessed":{"status":"Pooled"}}
//! attestation at tip 54: withheld — nothing_to_finalize=true new_state_transition=false
//!                                     quorum_reachable=true cadence_due=false paced=false
//! propose refused: Failure: Proposal failed: NoNewDeploys (seqNum 55)
//! ```
//!
//! A deploy anchored at **zero** on a chain that tall is born expired (`valid_after <= height - 50`,
//! `casper/src/validate.rs::deploy_expired_at_block`). `select_deploys` skips it as `expired` —
//! silently — and because a *settled* lone node withholds its attestation (`nothing_to_finalize =
//! true`, the #70 rule that a chain advances on content and not on wall-clock), not even the empty
//! attestation block is produced. So the height does not move **at all**: not a stall after proposing,
//! and not a refusal any caller can see, since `BlockApiImpl::deploy` discards the trigger's result
//! and the trigger's refusal is never logged. The tree names this trap in its own words
//! (`casper/src/protocol/client.rs::resolve_valid_after_block_number`: "born expired on any chain
//! taller than the lifespan … silently never proposed").
