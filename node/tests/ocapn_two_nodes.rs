//! **Two nodes, one session**: node A reaches an object on node B over the authenticated transport.
//!
//! Everything in `ocapn_listener.rs` puts a *test client* on one side of the wire. That proves the
//! listener, and it cannot prove the **dial**: the client there is this repository's own
//! `Session::dial`, driven from the test. Here both ends are nodes — A originates the session through
//! its own admin route (`POST /api/v1/ocapn/dial`, `enable-ocapn-dial`), B accepts it, and the object
//! A comes away holding is one B's bootstrap published. That is the shape issue #249 was opened for
//! and the shape a vat on another node has.
//!
//! **Why A listens as well as dials.** A node registers a transport on its dialer only when it also
//! *listens* on it (`serve_ocapn` builds the `MultiNetlayer` from the configured listeners), so a
//! node with no listener has nothing to dial *with* and its admin route answers 503. A therefore
//! carries its own `noise` listener and identity file: it is a node that happens to dial B, not a
//! bare dialer.
//!
//! **What the second half pins.** The same dial is repeated naming a *different* Ed25519 key than
//! the one B holds. B refuses the SYN at its cleartext-prefix check — before any cryptography — so
//! the route answers 502. That is what makes the first half mean "a Noise session with *this* node"
//! rather than "a socket was opened somewhere".
