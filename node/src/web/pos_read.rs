//! The PoS read surface the node did not have (AUDIT C148).
//!
//! `docs/src/node/operating.md` explains the epoch rule ("withdraw … only stages a deadline
//! (`pendingWithdrawers`) … the boundary is `blockNumber % epochLength == 0`") and then leaves the
//! operator to derive the boundary from block heights: the epoch counter, the active validator set
//! and `pendingWithdrawers` live in native state and were projected by no route and no subcommand.
//! `bond-status` answers a bool; `GET /api/v1/shards` answers heights. So an epoch or unbonding
//! question got answered by inference, or by hand-deploying rholang from a console on a live
//! validator — exactly the poking the REPL's isolated eval store exists to avoid for terms.
//!
//! **A trait of its own rather than a method on `BlockApi`.** The read needs the shard's
//! `RuntimeManager` and the status API, neither of which belongs on the block API — and adding a
//! method to `BlockApi` would have meant touching every mock of it in the tree, which is a large
//! diff for a read that no block-path caller wants.
