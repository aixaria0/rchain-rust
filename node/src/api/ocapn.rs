//! The node's OCapN listener (issue #249).
//!
//! OCapN is the object-capability network an Agoric vat speaks: a peer dials, the two sides
//! handshake over a netlayer, and the peer works against objects the node exports. This module is
//! the node's end of that — a listener that serves a fresh session per connection — and the
//! **bridge**: a chain-backed capability whose deliveries become signed deploys.
//!
//! **A node may listen on any of four transports, several, or (dial-only) none.**
//! `tcp-testing-only` is the OCapN project's own, which its README flags as "HIGHLY INSECURE — DO NOT
//! USE IN PRODUCTION": plain TCP, no encryption, no authentication, so it is off unless
//! `api-server.ocapn-listen` names an address and a node reachable from anywhere it does not control
//! should leave it unset. `unix` (`api-server.ocapn-listen-unix`) takes a socket path and
//! authenticates by the socket's file mode, but is reachable only from this host. **`noise`
//! (`api-server.ocapn-listen-noise`) is the one a remote peer should use**: the handshake authenticates
//! both ends and encrypts everything above it, with no certificate authority and no daemon, and it is
//! checked against Agoric's own implementation (`spec/audit/evidence/ocapn-noise/`).
//! `websocket` (`api-server.ocapn-listen-websocket`) is the transport `@endo/ocapn` speaks, so it is
//! the one a *published* peer can be pointed at — and it is **weaker**: as the reference writes it,
//! `ws://` carries no TLS and its handshake has only the server prove itself.
//!
//! **The last two need `api-server.ocapn-identity-key`**, because both name this node by an Ed25519
//! key it must hold: `noise` puts it in the SYN's cleartext prefix and `websocket` signs a challenge
//! with it. That key is also what makes the node's designator a name a peer can *check* rather than a
//! hash of the deployer key.
//!
//! **The bridge reuses Layer 1 rather than re-implementing it.** `docs/src/node/shard-invoke.md`
//! established that a cross-shard call *is* a caller-signed deploy whose reply arrives on
//! `` `rho:rchain:deployId` ``; a CapTP delivery is the same object with a different caller, so this
//! builds the term with [`invoke_term`], signs it with [`signed_invoke`], submits it through
//! `BlockApi::deploy` exactly as the faucet does, and reads the reply with [`reply_outcome`].
//!
//! **The reply path is the whole round trip.** A delivery is built into a term, signed, submitted,
//! and the value the deployed contract writes to the deploy's reply channel comes back as the CapTP
//! promise's fulfilment: `node/tests/ocapn_listener.rs` reads a REV balance out of a block that way.
//! **The reply channel being *bound* rather than written as a bare URI is load-bearing** (AUDIT
//! C218): a backticked `` `rho:rchain:deployId` `` is an ordinary, guessable name that nothing
//! reads, while the unforgeable per-deploy channel is what a `deployId(`rho:rchain:deployId`)`
//! binding introduces. Writing the URI instead sent every reply into a channel nobody watched and
//! the deploy still reported success.
