//! Proposer instance (port of `node/instances/ProposerInstance.scala`).
//!
//! Drains propose requests, serializing actual proposal through a semaphore; concurrent attempts
//! resolve to `ProposerResult::Empty` and set the `trigger` flag, so a propose that arrives while
//! one is running is re-enqueued once the running one finishes (the Scala's trigger re-enqueue).
//!
//! **A "not due" outcome is retried by the node itself** ([`NOT_DUE_RETRY`]). The round gate's wall-clock
//! escape is only evaluated when something asks this node to propose, and with `--no-autopropose` nothing
//! does until the next deploy or remote block arrives — so a deploy refused by the gate on a quiet net sat
//! in the pool until someone else spoke (#213, #219).
//!
//! **Every propose outcome is logged here, where it is produced.** Most propose requests discard
//! their result — the `proposeOnDeploy` path (`let _ = trigger(true).await`) and both autopropose
//! taps (`try_send` with the reply receiver dropped) — so a proposer that fails on every attempt
//! stops block production *silently*: `/api/status` keeps serving, the container stays healthy, and
//! the log stays empty while the height never moves. Logging at the point of production makes every
//! one of those paths visible at once, including the ones with no caller left to report to.
