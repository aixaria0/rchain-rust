# Talking to a node from another implementation

This page is for a developer whose code is **not Rholang**: you have an Agoric vat, an `@endo/ocapn`
client, or another CapTP implementation, and you want to hold and call objects on a running node.

For what the node exposes and how to configure it, see [OCapN interoperability](../node/ocapn.md).
This page is the client side: connect, fetch, call, read.

## 1. Turn the listener on

The listener is off by default. On the node you are dialling, set:

```hocon
api-server {
  ocapn-listen = "127.0.0.1:22045"
}
```

A chain-backed capability — anything an ERTP or REV call reaches — needs the node to have a deployer
key as well, because every call becomes a signed deploy:

```hocon
dev {
  deployer-private-key = "<hex secp256k1 private key>"
}
```

Without a key the node still completes a handshake and serves the conformance fixtures, but there is
no chain behind it to answer a call.

> **Bind loopback unless you mean it.** `tcp-testing-only` is plain TCP with no authentication, and a
> peer that connects can make the node spend its own REV as a deployer. See the warning in
> [OCapN interoperability](../node/ocapn.md) before publishing the port.

## 2. Dial

The netlayer is `tcp-testing-only`, and messages are netstring-framed (`<length>:<payload>`). With
Endo, the framing is `'syrup'` — its `'none'` mode interoperates with nothing.

```js
import '@endo/init';
import { makeClient } from '@endo/ocapn';
import { makeTcpNetLayer } from '@endo/ocapn/netlayer/tcp-testing';
import { E } from '@endo/eventual-send';

const client = makeClient({ debugLabel: 'rnode', verbose: true });
await client.registerNetlayer((handlers, logger) =>
  makeTcpNetLayer({
    handlers,
    logger,
    specifiedHostname: '127.0.0.1',
    specifiedPort: 0,
    framing: 'syrup',
  }),
);
```

From Rust, the same dial is a `Session`:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use rchain_ocapn::bootstrap::Bootstrap;
use rchain_ocapn::conn::{Identity, Session};
use rchain_ocapn::locator::PeerLocator;
use rchain_ocapn::netlayer::Netlayer;
use rchain_ocapn::tcp_testing_only::TcpTestingOnly;

let locator = PeerLocator {
    designator: "rnode".into(),
    transport: "tcp-testing-only".into(),
    hints: [("host".to_string(), "127.0.0.1".to_string()),
            ("port".to_string(), "22045".to_string())].into(),
};
let dialer = TcpTestingOnly::bind("127.0.0.1:0").await?;
let connection = dialer.new_outgoing_connection(&locator).await?;
let identity = Identity::fresh(locator.clone())?;
let mut session = Session::dial(connection, &identity, Arc::new(Bootstrap::default())).await?;
```

The designator is the label *you* give the peer in the locator you dial; it does not have to match the
node's own.

## 3. Fetch a capability

A peer is handed the node's **bootstrap object** at export 0. `fetch(swiss)` on it resolves a swiss
number to a capability and gives you back a reference you can call.

```js
const location = {
  type: 'ocapn-peer',
  designator: 'rnode',
  transport: 'tcp-testing-only',
  hints: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: '22045' },
};

const ertp = await client.enlivenSturdyRef(
  client.makeSturdyRef(location, 'rho:rchain:ertp'),
);
```

The node publishes two chain-backed swiss numbers — `rho:rchain:ertp` and
`rho:rchain:revVault/getBalance` — plus the conformance fixtures. In Rust the fetch is an `op:deliver`
to export 0:

```rust
use rchain_ocapn::captp::{Deliver, Desc};
use rchain_ocapn::syrup::Value;

let fetch = Deliver {
    to: Desc::Export(0u64.into()),
    args: vec![
        Value::Symbol("fetch".into()),
        Value::Bytes(b"rho:rchain:ertp".to_vec()),
    ],
    answer_pos: None,
    resolve_me_desc: Some(Desc::ImportObject(0u64.into())),
};
session.send_message(&fetch.to_syrup()).await?;
```

## 4. Call it

A delivery names a method and arguments, and the reply is either a value or a reference to another
object. When a call **returns a capability**, you get an object you can call in turn — that is what
makes the ERTP round trip work.

```js
// A kit is three capabilities: a brand, a mint and an issuer.
const kit = await E(ertp).makeIssuerKit();
const issuer = kit[2];

const purse = await E(issuer).makeEmptyPurse();
const balance = await E(purse).getCurrentAmount();   // [true, 0]
```

Two behaviours to expect:

- **Every call is a deploy.** It is signed by the node's key and submitted; the reply arrives when a
  block carrying it is produced, so a call takes a block interval, not a round trip. The node pays the
  phlo. On a node with autopropose off, you must cause a block.
- **Capabilities cross as references, values cross as data.** The kit's members and the purse above
  are remote references — the underlying Rholang names never leave the node. A `(true, 0)` reply crosses
  as OCapN's **tagged** value, `<desc:tagged 'rho:tuple' [true 0]>`, and comes back a tuple — Law 59
  (AUDIT C226). It crossed as a bare list once, and a list does not match a contract's
  `(brand, value)` pattern; that is why §5's round trip is possible at all.

## 5. What works today

| | |
|---|---|
| fetch a capability from the bootstrap | yes |
| call an arm that takes plain values | yes — strings, numbers, booleans, byte arrays, lists |
| call an arm that takes **a capability** | yes — pass a remote reference as an argument |
| hold a returned capability and call it | yes |
| pass an **amount** (`(brand, value)`) back to the node | yes — a tuple crosses as OCapN's tagged value |

The last row is the edge that has since been crossed. A tuple crosses to a peer as OCapN's **tagged**
value — `<desc:tagged 'rho:tuple' [fields…]>` — because a Syrup record is labelled and a Rholang tuple
has no label, and it comes back a **tuple**, so a contract's `(brand, value)` pattern matches. (A bare
list would not; that was the reading this wire shape replaced — AUDIT C226, Law 59.) The arms that
*move* value — `mintPayment(amount)`, `withdraw(amount)`, `revFund(funder, amount)` — are therefore
reachable. See [ERTP](../node/ertp.md) for the ledger underneath.

Also note:

- **Bridged deploys are rate-limited** to 4 per second across every session and capability; past that
  a delivery is refused with a reason naming the bound.
- **The node is the on-chain caller.** Every bridged deploy is signed by the node's deployer key, so
  the chain sees the node, not you. There is no session-to-deployer binding yet.
- **The node serves a fixed number of sessions** (64) — 48 to the connections it accepts, shared between
  whatever transports are listening, and 16 reserved for the sessions it dials itself. Past that a new
  connection is closed, and a dial past the reserve is refused with a reason naming the reserve.

## 6. Putting a shard in front of the peers

Everything above serves **one node**. The bridge signs every delivery with that node's key
(`dev.deployer-private-key`), so the chain's `deployerId` is the node and the node's REV pays the phlo.
That is fine for a demo and wrong for a boundary you publish: a peer's call spends your REV, and
nothing on chain records whose call it was.

A deployment that fixes the *shape* of that uses machinery already here: make the boundary a **shard**.

A node is a member of the shards listed in `casper.shards` — file-configured only, the first entry is
the primary and later ones get their own data directory under `<data-dir>/shard/`. A node with more
than one membership is a **gateway**; a shard whose only bonded key is that node is a **single-node
shard**. So:

```hocon
casper {
  shards = [
    { shard-name = root,  parent-shard-id = / }
    { shard-name = ocapn, parent-shard-id = /root, genesis-block-data { ... } }
  ]
  # The cross-shard routes, on the ADMIN server. Only a node with more than one shard
  # membership and a validator key serves them; the coordinator signs each leg with that
  # key and spends from its own REV account (AUDIT C121).
  enable-txn-api = true
}
api-server {
  ocapn-listen = "127.0.0.1:22045"
}
dev {
  deployer-private-key = "<hex secp256k1 private key>"
}
```

The peers dial that node. The ERTP objects they hold live in `root/ocapn`'s state, and a call that has
to reach the rest of the network leaves as a **cross-shard transaction** — a two-phase commit this node
coordinates (`casper/src/txn_coordinator.rs`, Laws 26–29).

**What it buys.** The perimeter becomes a *named shard* rather than "the node", and the spend becomes
bounded and visible: one shard's REV, one validator key, a shard-level fact — instead of the node's
own key paying for calls it did not make. The txn routes' config note says the same thing in its own
words: the coordinator "signs each leg with this node's validator key and spends from that key's own
REV account".

**Why it is not a trick.** The coordinator's record is deliberately **node-local, not consensus state**
(`casper/src/gateway/ledger.rs`, first paragraph): writing one node's off-chain coordination into the
content-addressed trie would make a shard's state hash depend on that node's off-chain work and diverge
consensus. That is the same rule the OCapN session already follows — the export and answer tables are
per-session and never chain state — so a shard acting as the boundary does nothing a gateway does not
already do.

**What it costs, and what it does not fix.** Each call that crosses becomes a 2PC transaction: atomic,
but dearer than today's single deploy, and it has a coordinator that can stall. A one-key shard
localises trust rather than removing it — the boundary's integrity is that validator. And the peer
still is not the payer: the boundary shard's key is *yours*. That obligation is stated, and left open,
in `spec/Rchain/Attribution.lean`; it closes only when the peer is itself a chain, which is what the
next section is about.

**Status.** The pieces are built and tested separately — `node/tests/gateway.rs` runs two shards in one
node and coordinates a two-shard transaction, and the bridge's tests are above — but the *combination*
in this section has not been run in this repository. It is the deployment these parts add up to, not a
recipe anyone has followed.

**Dialling out.** The node dials on a peer's word — the enlivener connects to a sturdyref's locator and
the greeter to a handoff give's `exporter-location` — and, since issue #249, on its **own**: `POST
/api/v1/ocapn/dial` on the admin server makes the node dial a peer a caller names and fetch the object
at the swiss number it gives. Both uses are the *same code* (`Enlivener::dial_and_fetch`), because a
dial the node starts and one a peer asked for differ in who asked, not in what a dial is.

**Per-transport dispatch is built**: `ocapn/src/multi.rs`'s `MultiNetlayer` routes a dial by the
locator's transport name, and the node hands it to its fixtures and its own dialer, so a peer dialled
over unix and one dialled over TCP are reached by the layer each named.

Neither is free of the perimeter below: "dial an address of the peer's choosing" *is* the SSRF surface
the dial policy exists for, so a gateway that dials out is one that wants `ocapn-deny-local-dial` set
and the origin rule holding — the same trade Law 62 names. **The node-started dial has no origin**, so
Law 62's origin rule cannot apply to it: there is no peer asking. What guards it is the target policy
(`ocapn-deny-local-dial`) plus the route's own `enable-ocapn-dial` gate, the loopback-by-default admin
bind, and a rate limit — which is why that route is off by default.

## 7. Writing a transport

The node speaks four: `tcp-testing-only`, the conformance suite's own transport — plain TCP, no
encryption, no authentication, which is why the listener is off unless you name an address — `unix`, a
domain socket authenticated by its file mode (`0600`) but reachable only from this host; `noise`, which
is the one a remote peer should use; and `websocket`, which is the one `@endo/ocapn` speaks and the
weaker of the two networked ones. A fifth is small, because the seam is two functions
(`ocapn/src/netlayer.rs`):

```rust
async fn new_outgoing_connection(&self, locator: &PeerLocator) -> io::Result<Box<dyn NetConn>>;
async fn accept_incoming_connection(&self) -> io::Result<Box<dyn NetConn>>;
```

plus `NetConn::peer_address` and a provided `new_outgoing_connection_from(locator, origin)`, which
exists so the dial policy can tell a *remote* peer from a local one (see the node page). Three things
to know before writing one:

- **The locator already names the transport.** It is `ocapn://<designator>.<transport>`, and designator
  plus transport *is* the spec's peer identity (`ocapn/src/locator.rs`) — so a new transport is a name
  plus whatever hints it needs. Dispatch is by that name: `ocapn/src/multi.rs` routes a dial to the
  layer the locator names, and the node holds one `MultiNetlayer` over its transports.
- **`recv` promises a bidirectional FIFO and nothing else.** Not liveness, not that the session stays
  up. CapTP above assumes it does, and `op:abort` has no analogue on a packet network — so decide what
  a session means when a packet is merely late before writing one.
- **A transport built on a chain gives you the payer.** Packets on IBC are sent by a chain that pays
  for its own gas, which closes the attribution obligation this repository states and leaves open. That
  is the strongest reason to want one.

### Which transport

The implementations this repository tests against carry four transports between them, and none is a
production one: the conformance suite (`31f0b80`) has `testing_only_tcp` and `onion` (Tor), and the
Endo version vendored for the spike (`1.1.1`) has `tcp-test-only` and `websocket`. So the transport to
write is the one the peers you care about actually speak — and whatever it is, it is the two functions
above with the channel underneath it, and nothing above the seam moves.

**Noise is built, and it is the one a deployment should use.** `ocapn/src/noise.rs`, bound with
`api-server.ocapn-listen-noise`; it needs `api-server.ocapn-identity-key`, because the handshake names
the node by an Ed25519 key it must hold. **The gate that held it back was interop, and it is now
measured rather than argued:** Agoric's endo repository carries `rust/ocapn_noise` and
`packages/ocapn-noise`, pinning the pattern (`XX`), the primitives (X25519, ChaCha20Poly1305,
BLAKE2s), the empty prologue, the message sizes, and — the part that is application protocol — the
payload of a verifying key and a signature over the sender's X25519 static, behind a 32-byte cleartext
prefix naming the intended responder. `spec/audit/evidence/ocapn-noise/` drives that reference, at a
pinned commit, against this module, and the handshake completes. **Read that transcript before changing
anything in the handshake**: it also says what the run does *not* cover — the record framing, for which
the reference ships no counterpart.

**`websocket` is built too, and is the weaker of the two** (`ocapn/src/websocket.rs`,
`api-server.ocapn-listen-websocket`). Its reason to exist is that `@endo/ocapn` 1.1.1 — a *published*
peer — speaks it. What the reference actually defines, read rather than assumed: framing is **one
WebSocket frame per CapTP message with nothing inside it**; the URL is a single `url` hint used
verbatim, with no path or query; and before any CapTP byte there is an in-band **`init:peer-auth` /
`desc:sig-envelope`** exchange in which the server signs the bytes it received and the client checks
that signature against the key the dial named. As Endo writes it, `ws://` has **no TLS** and the
*client* proves nothing, so this transport adds interop breadth and not security — reach for `noise`.
The reference also sets **no size limit and no timeout anywhere**; the bounds in the module are this
port's additions and say so.

**Name this node the way that peer does** (AUDIT C245). Endo identifies a location by
`ocapn://<designator>.<transport>?<sorted hints>` — every hint included — and resolves a session under
the location it dialled, so its `designator` for this node is `base32(Ed25519 verifying key)`, which is
what this node advertises and what a client must dial. A hex designator, or one carrying a hint the
client did not send, is a *different* location: the client completes the handshake, stores the session
under your advertisement, looks it up under its own, and then sends nothing at all. The round trip is
`spec/audit/evidence/endo-spike/run-4.txt`.

### Unix domain sockets as the inner hop

**Implemented** as `ocapn/src/unix.rs`, bound with `api-server.ocapn-listen-unix`. It is the smallest
transport that is not `testing-only`, and the security is the operating system's rather than ours: a
UDS peer is a process whose uid and gid the socket's filesystem permissions admitted. That is
authentication, where `tcp-testing-only` has none, with no key exchange to write. The netlayer is the
same two functions — connect to a path, accept on a bound socket — plus `transport = "unix"` and a
`path` hint. `NetConn::peer_address` returns `None` for it, which the dial policy reads as "cannot be
judged" and which is right here: a UDS peer is local by construction, and the permission on the socket
is what admitted it.

**And it is the right place to compose.** A gateway speaking UDS to a handful of local agents, each of
which speaks something else outward, keeps the wide-area transport and its credentials out of the
chain-facing process — and gives the accountability a home, because each agent is a process the
operator started deliberately, with its own identity. That is the shape section 6's payer question
wants: the boundary shard is the chain's side, the agents are the network's side, and neither has to
be the other.
