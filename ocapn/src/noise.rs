//! The `noise` netlayer — TCP under a Noise `XX` handshake, and the transport OCapN is converging on.
//!
//! **What makes this different from `tcp_testing_only`.** That transport is plaintext and
//! unauthenticated: any peer that can reach the port is trusted, which is why its own README says
//! "HIGHLY INSECURE — DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION" and why the listener is off unless configured. This
//! one completes a Noise `XX` handshake before a single CapTP byte moves, so the channel is encrypted
//! and **both** ends are authenticated: each side proves it holds an Ed25519 signing key by signing
//! its own X25519 static public key, and `XX` binds those statics to the session. No certificate
//! authority and no daemon are involved — a node needs a key pair and a listening port.
//!
//! **The parameters are Agoric's, not ours, and that is the entire basis on which this is
//! interoperable.** `XX` with X25519, ChaCha20Poly1305 and **BLAKE2s**, an **empty prologue**, the
//! three-flight handshake — SYN 132 B sent behind a 32-byte **cleartext prefix** naming the intended
//! responder, SYNACK 193 B, ACK 64 B — and, the part that is *application* protocol rather than Noise,
//! a payload of the sender's Ed25519 verifying key followed by its signature over its own X25519
//! static public. All of that is pinned by `rust/ocapn_noise` and `packages/ocapn-noise` in Agoric's
//! endo repository, which this module mirrors step for step, and the same `noise-protocol` and
//! `noise-rust-crypto` crates produce the bytes on both sides, so the two implementations are the same
//! code underneath rather than two that have to be argued equivalent.
//!
//! **A dial therefore has to name the peer's Ed25519 key**, in the locator's `verify` hint (base16):
//! the SYN's prefix *is* that key, and a responder refuses a SYN whose prefix is not its own before
//! doing any cryptography — so the prefix is not decoration, it is the frame, and it is also what lets
//! an intermediary route a handshake it must not be able to read.
//!
//! **Interoperability here is a measured fact, not an argument.** `spec/audit/evidence/ocapn-noise/`
//! drives Agoric's own core, fetched at a pinned commit, against this module: the reference accepts
//! our SYN and our ACK and messages decrypt in both directions. What that run does **not** cover — the
//! record framing, for which the reference ships no counterpart — is written into the transcript
//! rather than left for a reader to assume from a green result.
//!
//! **Framing is this module's own, and it chunks.** A Noise transport message carries at most 65535
//! bytes, well under the CapTP messages this codebase produces, so a message longer than one cipher
//! message is split and each chunk is encrypted separately — the cipher state's nonce advances per
//! chunk, so the chunks are ordered and a re-order or a drop is a decryption failure rather than a
//! silent corruption. [`crate::framed`] is not reused: it frames with netstrings, and its own doc
//! already says a transport with different framing writes its own module.
//!
//! **`peer_address` is reported**, unlike [`crate::unix`]. This is TCP underneath, so the dial policy
//! *can* judge a peer of this transport and Law 62's origin rule applies to it in full — a remote
//! Noise peer may not aim this node at one of the node's own local addresses. That the channel is
//! encrypted says nothing about where the peer is or what it may reach.
