//! The netlayer abstraction: a bidirectional FIFO between two peers.
//!
//! `draft-specifications/Netlayers.md` and the implementation guide present two functions —
//! `new_outgoing_connection(ocapn_locator)` and `accept_incoming_connection()` — over a channel
//! that is "a bidirectional FIFO". CapTP stays "agnostic to latency, liveness, and privacy
//! characteristics of each underlying protocol": those are the netlayer's business, and the
//! protocol above sees only a queue of messages.
//!
//! A message on the channel is one CapTP operation, carried as one Syrup value. The netlayers
//! implemented here are [`crate::tcp_testing_only`] — the conformance suite's transport —
//! [`crate::unix`], a domain socket authenticated by the socket's file mode but local to the host, and
//! [`crate::noise`], which is the one a remote peer can use, with [`crate::multi`] dispatching a dial
//! by the locator's transport name.
//!
//! **Noise was once deliberately not built, and the reason it is now is worth keeping.** It is the
//! transport OCapN names for a real deployment, and a layer that only this repository speaks would
//! talk to itself — so it waited on **a reference that speaks it**. Agoric's endo repository now
//! carries one (`rust/ocapn_noise` and `packages/ocapn-noise`), which pins the parameters that would
//! otherwise be guesses and gives something to test against: `spec/audit/evidence/ocapn-noise/` drives
//! it, at a pinned commit, and the handshake completes. **That is the shape to keep for the next
//! transport** — the gate is a reachable reference, and a layer written before one exists is
//! un-verifiable whatever its arguments look like.
//!
//! What is still not built is `onion` (Tor), the only concrete transport in the OCapN draft: it needs
//! a `tor` daemon on the node, and the draft that fixes it says it is "likely to undergo significant
//! change". Any further netlayer (libp2p, IBC) implements the same two functions with nothing above
//! the seam moving.
