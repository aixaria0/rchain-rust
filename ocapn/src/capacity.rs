//! Bounded tables, and the caps the peer-facing ones use.
//!
//! **Why a type and not a check.** Six tables in this crate grow on input a peer chooses: the export
//! and answer tables, the gift store and its replay guard, a promise's listener list, and the registry
//! of peers. Every one of them was an ordinary `BTreeMap`/`Vec`, so a peer could grow the node's
//! memory without bound — measured by the HAZOP's red team, three independent vectors, `gifts` at
//! 191 B per message (AUDIT C223).
//!
//! A check at each insert site would work until someone adds a seventh site and forgets, which is the
//! shape of every "we already bound that" claim this repository has had to correct. [`Bounded`] has
//! **no unbounded constructor and no `insert`**: the only way in is [`Bounded::try_insert`], which
//! answers `Err(Full)` and names the cap. A site that forgets to handle `Full` does not compile.
//!
//! **The caps are on the count, so the keys must be bounded separately.** A count of 1024 over a key a
//! peer may make 4 MiB long is a 4 GiB table — which is why [`MAX_GIFT_ID`], [`MAX_DESIGNATOR`],
//! [`MAX_TRANSPORT`] and [`MAX_HINTS`] live here beside the counts, and why [`check_peer_sized`] is
//! the function a caller must run on a peer's own bytes *before* they become a key. Counts are
//! calibrated from a per-session memory budget, not from a multiple of the conformance suite's usage:
//! the suite is one cooperative client, and a node's cap has to hold for the largest legitimate holder.
