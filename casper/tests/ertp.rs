//! **The ERTP object API** — `casper/src/genesis/resources/ERTP.rho` over the native issuer ledger
//! (`rho:rchain:ertp:ledger`, W2.1). Issue #249, condition 3.
//!
//! The contract is installed here the way any deploy is: `compute_genesis` plays the `.rho` file as
//! an ordinary deploy signed by a fixed key, so the URI the file registers itself under is derivable
//! (`registry_insert_signed` derives it from the deployer's public key) and a second deploy can look
//! the contract up and call it. **Nothing in this file consults the blessing** — the alias tier
//! (`rho:rchain:ertp`) is W2.3's, and the fresh-chain gate that uses it is W2.4's. That is the
//! separation the two tests exist for: this one proves the contract, the other proves the blessing.
//!
//! Every assertion is read back out of the **block path**, not out of the contract: the driver
//! deploy reports each observation on its own `@"tag"` channel, and a missing tag is a failed
//! assertion with a name. That matters because an unmatched `for` in Rholang is silent — the failure
//! mode this port keeps meeting is a call that reaches nothing and looks like a client bug.
//!
//! The load-bearing clause is [`a_payment_of_one_brand_is_refused_by_another_brands_purse_and_survives_it`]:
//! a refused cross-brand deposit must leave the payment **live**, which is what distinguishes a
//! brand check from a burn.
