//! The native system-contract store: byte-oriented state (registry / PoS / vault) folded into the
//! same content-addressed radix trie as the tuple space.
//!
//! Native state is stored under dedicated trie prefixes (`PREFIX_REGISTRY`/`PREFIX_POS`/
//! `PREFIX_VAULT`) as `NativeLeaf` payloads. The `InMemNativeStore` is a write-through overlay on top
//! of a `NativeHistoryReader`: reads fall through to the persisted trie, writes are buffered in the
//! overlay, and `drain_changes` produces the `NativeStoreAction`s that the history repository folds
//! into the next checkpoint. This mirrors the `HotStore`/`HistoryRepository` split so native state
//! stays content-addressed, replayable, and queryable at an arbitrary state hash.
