# Law 63 — a bridged delivery's consensus footprint is attributable

Every delivery to a method-carrying chain capability runs `register!(reply, *uriOut)` unconditionally
(`casper/src/shard_invoke.rs`'s `invoke_member_term`, even for a reply that is pure data), and
`rho:registry:insertArbitrary` has **no delete** anywhere — so each call leaves a permanent consensus
entry holding the whole reply, including any capabilities in it, on every node that replays the block.
The same deploy pays `CHAIN_PHLO_LIMIT` out of the node's own deployer vault (AUDIT C221).

**Why this is a law and not a missing bound.** The obvious repair — bound it — is what the row proposed
first and what the design pass showed is impossible: the node cannot know whether a reply holds a
capability *before* registering it, because the value does not survive the evaluation. So the
statement cannot be "the state is bounded" (Law 55's clause, which the OCapN surface's own guards
satisfy — see C222). It is *whose* state it is: a write a session caused must be one the session's peer
pays for, and here it is one this node pays for out of a vault it chose to fund.

**The row is `open`, and that is the honest state.** The relay is the close: the node hands the peer
the exact `DeployData` to sign with its own secp256k1 key, so the chain binds the peer as
`deployerId`, the peer's vault pays, and the `insertArbitrary` registration becomes the caller's own
act. Endo does not speak this shard's `DeployData` shape, so it is a cross-implementation protocol
change and cannot be landed here — the row says so rather than naming a fix that this tree cannot
reach. What the model adds is that the failure is a *theorem* rather than a paragraph, and that the
law is not vacuous: `the_relay_would_satisfy_it` exhibits the shape a fix has to have.

/-- **Law 63's failure, as a theorem.** A write a session caused is not attributable to the caller: the
node pays for phlo it did not choose to spend and carries consensus state it cannot remove. This is why
the row is `open` rather than `done` — the law is stated and the code does not satisfy it. -/

the state is bounded by what the caller's own phlo bought. -/
def AttributableWrite (w : LedgerWrite) (bound : Nat) : Prop :=
  w.payer = Payer.theCaller ∧ w.state ≤ bound

/-- **The law is not vacuous.** The relay — the close condition C221's row names — is what makes
`AttributableWrite` inhabited: the peer signs and funds the deploy, so the payer is the caller and the
state is bounded by what the caller's own phlo bought. Stated as a witness rather than assumed, so that
"there is a shape that satisfies this" is checked and not hoped for. -/

/-- And the failure is not a matter of *degree*: no bound on `state` makes `bridgedWrite` attributable,
because what the law is about is the payer. This is the sentence the row's first proposed close
condition got wrong — a smaller write is the same unattributable write. -/
