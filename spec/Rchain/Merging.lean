# Law 17 — the merge arithmetic, and the RNG merge at its call site

The port's numeric-channel merge lives in `rholang/src/merging.rs`: `calculate_number_channel_merge`
(`:80-132`) and `calculate_num_channel_diff` (`:299-321`). Both do their arithmetic with the **checked**
`i64` operations, so a value that would leave the signed 64-bit range is *refused* rather than wrapped —
`checked_add` with the message "number channel merge overflow", `checked_sub` with "number channel diff
overflow". This module models exactly those two paths, and nothing else, because the law the catalogue
was carrying here — "numeric channels are non-negative" — was **false of the code**: numeric channels are
signed `i64` and negative diffs are ordinary (`merging.rs:161-166`; the tests at `:349,370` use
`diff: -5` and `-10`). `NonNegI64` is a real newtype in `shared/src/refined.rs:64`, but it types *bonds*
and *heights*, not numeric channels, and the old law conflated them.

## What one of the two paths does *not* do, which the law must therefore not claim

The merge refuses to wrap; the diff *accumulator* does not. Combining two branch index maps adds with a
plain `i64 +=`:

    rspace/src/merger/event_log_index.rs:151      *number_channels.entry(*k).or_insert(0) += *v;
    casper/src/merging.rs:758                     *mergeable_diffs.entry(*k).or_insert(0) += v;

so at the accumulator a debug build panics and a release build wraps. Nothing refuses that addition.
That is a finding about the code rather than a theorem about a model, so it is recorded in
`spec/AUDIT.md` and named in the register's Law 17 row — this module does not dress it up as a law.

## The RNG merge, and why there is no commutativity axiom here

The catalogue used to carry `mergeRandom_comm`. It was false: the primitive's Rust signature is
`Blake2b512Random::merge(children: &[Self])` — n-ary, and order-*sensitive*, pinned by the primitive's
own test (`crypto/src/hash/blake2b512_random.rs:548`, `merge_is_order_sensitive`).

But the *law* the axiom was reaching for is true where it matters: the merge's only caller canonicalizes
first. `merging.rs:121-124` dedups the branch generators and **sorts them by their bytes** before
merging:

    randoms.retain(|r| seen.insert(r.to_bytes()));
    randoms.sort_by_key(|r| r.to_bytes());
    Blake2b512Random::merge(&randoms)

So the merged state is a function of the *set* of branch generators, and `mergeRandoms_perm` below is
that fact proved from `Rchain/Cmp.lean`'s `sortList_perm` — the same sort-then-hash shape as Law 1.

/-! ## Law 17a — the rejection a conflict set resolves to, and why it is unique

`sdk/src/dag/merging.rs`'s `resolve_conflict_set` (`:395-445`) turns a conflict set into
`(accepted, rejected)`: it closes the conflict map under dependencies, computes the *rejection options*
(settling a conflict means rejecting a branch, together with whatever depends on it), extends them with
whatever an overflow forces, and then picks one — `compute_optimal_rejection` (`:278-295`):

    options.iter().min_by(|a, b| (cost(a), a.len(), a).cmp(&(cost(b), b.len(), b)))

**This row used to say the port "does not choose among candidates, so a claim about a unique
minimum-cost candidate has nothing in the code to be stated against" — that was wrong**, and the line
above is the choice. The law's word *unique* is load-bearing, and not decoration: `min_by` returns an
element of a `BTreeSet`, so the answer is a function of the *set* only if no two distinct options
compare equal. The key `(total cost, size, the sorted set)` is linear, which is why it works —
`optionComparator` below, built from `Rchain.Cmp`'s comparators, whose `eq_iff` is the fact
`the_minimum_is_unique` turns on. -/

/-- A rejection option: the port holds these in a `BTreeSet`, so a **sorted** list here, and a deploy is
    a `Nat` — the resolution never looks inside one. -/
abbrev RejectionOption := List Nat

    as a `foldl` because this prelude has no `List.sum`. -/
def totalCost (cost : Nat → Int) (o : RejectionOption) : Int :=
  o.foldl (fun acc d => acc + cost d) 0

/-- The port's `min_by` key: total cost, size, and the set itself. -/
def optionKey (cost : Nat → Int) (o : RejectionOption) : Int × Nat × List Nat :=

  Comparator.cmpPair (Comparator.linearOrderComparator Int)
    (Comparator.cmpPair (Comparator.linearOrderComparator Nat)
      (Comparator.listComparator (Comparator.linearOrderComparator Nat)))

/-- The port's option order, on options: the key's order pulled back along `optionKey`. The three laws
    come from the key's comparator, `eq_iff` using that the key *contains* the option (its third
    component), which is exactly why no two distinct options can compare equal. -/

/-! ## Law 17c — the native relation is on the chain, not the block

The rows above model the merge's **selection**. This one models the relation the selection runs over,
because that relation is where #280's defect lived and because the choice of *what a rejection unit is*
is not a detail of the search — it decides what can be lost.

The port carries each block's native state changes as `BlockIndex.native_changes`, a flat
`Vec<NativeStoreAction>` (`casper/src/merging.rs`). The relation that decides conflicts reads that
**host block's** set — `NativeRelations::conflicting` takes the union over the block's chains — and the
rejection rule is over the host too: `reject_whole_blocks` removes every chain of a rejected block, on
the stated grounds that "native effects are block-level and were computed with every chain's effects".
At an epoch boundary every block runs `close_block`, so every block's host set holds the epoch's slots
and **every** pair of concurrent blocks conflicts — including the pairs whose user chain wrote no
contended slot at all. The user deploy's effects then die with a contention they had no part in, which is
exactly what the live capture records (`spec/audit/evidence/n280-merge-loses-a-write-results.md`: the
write present at heights 100, 101 and 102, gone from 103, with the boundary blocks' `CloseBlock` ids in
the rejected set).

**What this law does not model.** The rejection-*option enumeration* over the conflict graph — the
maximal conflict-free sets the search returns, and the budget that bounds it — is still not modelled
here; it is the piece law 17a's note names as law 9's and it would be a second model of
`sdk/src/dag/merging.rs`'s `compute_rejection_options`. What is modelled is the relation and the
acceptance predicate, which is what the defect falsified. -/

/-- One deploy chain, as the native relation sees it: the block it rode in on, and the native slots its
    **own** deploys wrote. `host` stands for the port's `host_block`, `slots` for the `(prefix, key)`
    pairs its actions touch (`NativeStoreAction::slot`) folded into a set. -/
structure Chain where
  host : Nat
  slots : Finset Nat
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- The native relation at the **chain** level: two chains of different blocks, sharing a slot, neither
    having seen the other. `sees` is a parameter rather than a field because it comes from the DAG's
    ancestry (`MergeScope::ancestry`) and is not a function of the two chains — the same reason the
    port's `NativeRelations` reads it out of the scope rather than off the chains. -/
def chainConflict (sees : Chain → Chain → Prop) (a b : Chain) : Prop :=
  a.host ≠ b.host ∧ (a.slots ∩ b.slots).Nonempty ∧ ¬ sees a b ∧ ¬ sees b a

    `native_keys: BTreeMap<host, BTreeSet<slot>>`, built by unioning the block's chains. -/
def hostSlots (cs : List Chain) (h : Nat) : Finset Nat :=
  cs.foldl (fun acc c => if c.host = h then acc ∪ c.slots else acc) ∅

/-- The native relation at the **block** level — what the port applied before this law, and what a
    chain is rejected by. Note that it says nothing about *which* chain wrote the shared slot: that is
    the whole of the defect. -/
def hostConflict (cs : List Chain) (a b : Chain) : Prop :=
  a.host ≠ b.host ∧ (hostSlots cs a.host ∩ hostSlots cs b.host).Nonempty

/-- **The incident's shape, as data.** One block (host `1`) carried two chains: its boundary chain,
    which ran `close_block` and wrote the epoch's slots `{1, 2}`, and its user deploy's chain, which
    wrote **no native slot at all** (`∅`). A concurrent sibling (host `2`) wrote the same two slots.
    This is the round the live chain ran at height 100. -/
def incidentChains : List Chain :=
  [⟨1, {1, 2}⟩, ⟨1, ∅⟩, ⟨2, {1, 2}⟩]

/-- **The rule that stood, refuted.** At the block level the user chain conflicts with the sibling —
    different hosts, and the *host* key sets overlap — while at the chain level it does not, because its
    own slot set is empty. So the rule that stood rejects a chain that wrote nothing contended, and that
    is how a user deploy's effects came to die for a slot they never touched. The two sides here are the
    falsifier: `hostConflict` is the shape the port applied and `¬ chainConflict` is the shape this law
    requires, of the *same* pair of chains. -/

/-- **The fold's refusal**, as the port computes it: two accepted chains that both wrote one slot and
    that the order cannot sequence. The port sequences two writers of one slot only when one saw the
    other — a descendant's absolute value already includes its ancestor's — or when they are chains of
    **one** block, where the block's own execution order decides. That second arm is what this law's fix
    adds (`first_deploy_ordinal`); the block-level rule had no need of it because it never applied two
    chains of one block separately. -/

  ∃ a ∈ kept, ∃ b ∈ kept, a ≠ b ∧ (a.slots ∩ b.slots).Nonempty ∧

/-- **The resolution's own guarantee**: no two kept chains are in conflict. This is the predicate the
    search hands the fold, and it is witnessed independently on the Rust side

/-- **Law 17c's positive half: the resolution leaves the fold nothing to refuse.** `resolves` is stated
    on `chainConflict` and `foldRefuses` on its own shared-slot-and-unsequenced shape, so this is a bridge
    between two independently defined predicates rather than a restatement of either: a kept pair that
    shares a slot and is unsequenced *is* a chain conflict, which `resolves` forbids. It is what lets the
    fold's refusal be made **loud** rather than defensively swallowed — after this law the refusal is
    unreachable on any state the resolution can produce, so a report of one is a defect and not a
    judgement call. -/

/-- **And the refusal is not an empty predicate**, which is what makes the theorem above a statement
    about a reachable shape rather than about nothing: two chains of different blocks that wrote one slot
    without either having seen the other are exactly what the fold refuses. (`hostSlotWriters` in the
    port is this pair; the fix's job is to keep such a pair out of the *kept* set, not to make the
