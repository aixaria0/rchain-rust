# Laws 44–47 — Proof-of-Stake: the epoch gate, the reward split, and the dust

The port's native PoS state (`rholang/src/native_state.rs`) implements the validator lifecycle — bond,
withdraw, slash, trust — and **the epoch gate it used to skip now exists**: where `close_block` once
refunded quarantined withdrawers and recomputed `pos:active` on *every* block, never reading
`PosParams.epoch_length`, it now runs those steps only at a boundary, matching the Scala contract it
replaces (`legacy/casper/src/main/resources/Pos.rhox`: `blockNumber % $$epochLength$$ == 0`, :517;
rewards computed at the boundary, `getCurrentEpochRewards` :241-256, and committed,
`commitCurrentEpochRewards` :568-576; only expired quarantines paid, :556-567, :592-621). The port
keeps the contract's *meaning* for a zero epoch length (`native_state.rs:632-647`: the divisor is
`max(epoch_length, 1)`, so a zero means one-block epochs rather than a division fault).

Laws 44 and 47 remain `open` for a different reason: what they name is the **state machine** the gate
guards, and until this module grows one the laws are claims about the Rust evidenced by Rust tests.
That is this file's Programme C item, and the two properties are conservation (an epoch moves value
between the vaults and mints none) and the release rule (a withdrawal is staged, then escrowed out of
the pool, then paid `bond + committed` — and only at a boundary past its quarantine).

## The reward split does not conserve, and the law has to say so

`getCurrentEpochRewards` divides **twice** with integer division:

    reward_i = pot * (bond_i / minimumBond) / (activeBonds / minimumBond)

so `Σ reward_i` is the pot *minus dust* — the sum of the floored shares, re-floored. A conservation law
written as an equality would be **false**, and the Scala's own comment does not say which it means. The
model settles it: `list_sum_div_le` and `sum_rewards_le_pot` below are the inequality, and the instance
at the end is a case where it is *strict* — which is what makes the statement falsifiable rather than a
restatement of an accounting identity.

of one fold, and Mathlib's big-operators import would pull a tree the spec does not otherwise need. -/

namespace Rchain

/-- The distributable pot of an epoch: `posBalance - totalBond - totalWithdraw - totalCommittedRewards`
(`Pos.rhox:241-256`). The Scala computes it in `Long` and the contract's guards keep it non-negative, so
the model is a `Nat` subtraction — the floor is the *stated* part, not an artefact of the type. -/
def rewardPot (posBalance totalBond totalWithdraw committed : Nat) : Nat :=
  posBalance - totalBond - totalWithdraw - committed

/-- One active validator's epoch reward, exactly as `getCurrentEpochRewards` divides it: the pot scaled
by the validator's bond over `minimumBond`, normalised by the active set's bond over `minimumBond`. -/
def reward (pot minimumBond activeBonds bond : Nat) : Nat :=
  pot * (bond / minimumBond) / (activeBonds / minimumBond)

/-- **The integer division that makes the split conservative**: `⌊a/m⌋ + ⌊b/m⌋ ≤ ⌊(a+b)/m⌋`. Two
floors never add up to more than the floor of the sum, which is why the reward formula leaves a
remainder rather than distributing the pot exactly. -/

/-- **Law 46 — the epoch's split never pays out more than the pot**, and the remainder is the dust of two
integer divisions. Stated over the list of active bonds rather than a map, because the formula only ever
reads each bond through `bond / minimumBond`.

The hypotheses are the contract's own: the active set's bond total is the sum of its members'
(`hactive`), and the normaliser is positive (`hD`) — which is the only hypothesis the proof needs, and
it is the one that carries `minimumBond > 0` with it: `activeBonds / minimumBond` is positive only if the
divisor is, so a `minimumBond` of zero is already excluded. `activeBonds / minimumBond = 0` would be a
contract that pays every validator nothing, which is the shape the hypothesis refuses. -/
theorem sum_rewards_le_pot (pot minimumBond activeBonds : Nat) (bonds : List Nat)

    _ ≤ pot * (activeBonds / minimumBond) / (activeBonds / minimumBond) := hmono
    _ = pot := Nat.mul_div_cancel _ hD

/-- **The inequality is strict, so it is not an accounting identity in disguise.** `minimumBond = 3`,
bonds `[4, 8]`: the normaliser is `12 / 3 = 4`, and the validators' scaled shares are `4/3 = 1` and
`8/3 = 2`, so with a pot of ten they are paid `10 * 1 / 4 = 2` and `10 * 2 / 4 = 5` and the epoch
distributes **7 of 10** — three units of dust, which is the whole content of law 46. A statement that
said `Σ = pot` would be refuted by this line.

**And the shares must differ, which is the only reason the bonds above are 4 and 8** (AUDIT C149). This
witness used to bond `[4, 5]`, where `4/3 = 5/3 = 1`: the proportionality factor `bond / minimumBond`
was the identity for *every* validator in the instance, so a `reward` that dropped the factor entirely —
paying each active validator `pot / (activeBonds / minimumBond)` — satisfied this line exactly as the
real one did, and the module's Rust twin with it. The comment that stood here *stated* that collapse as
the evidence of strictness ("each validator's scaled share is `4/3 = 1` and `5/3 = 1`"), which is the
part worth keeping: a fixture whose parameters make the term under test the identity cannot witness that
term, however exact the assertion about it is, and reasoning carefully about the arithmetic does not
prevent it — this one was reasoned about. `8/3 = 2` is the smallest change that breaks the tie and keeps
the dust strict. -/

end Rchain

/-! ## The state machine the arithmetic above sits inside (laws 44 and 47)

The first half of this file models the epoch's *arithmetic* — the pot and the split. What laws 44 and 47
name is the **state machine** around it: the gate that decides whether an epoch happens at all, the four
ordered steps `close_block` runs when it does, and the three stages a withdrawal passes through. That
machine was missing, so both laws were claims about the Rust evidenced only by Rust tests. It is here
now, mirroring `rholang/src/native_state.rs` — field for field where a rule reads the field, and step for
step in `close_block`'s order (`:1083-1158`), because the order carries meaning: the rewards are
committed **before** a leaving validator is moved out of the pool, which is what lets a validator earn in
the epoch it leaves.

## What conservation is, and what it is not

`totalRev` sums the **coin fields only**. The pool, the requests, the claims and the committed map are
*liabilities against the staking vault* — ledger entries, not coins — which is why the Rust's own
`total_value` helper sums exactly the three coin fields (`native_state.rs:915-961`), and why the port's
`slash`-minted-before-`ba9e259a7` bug is this theorem's motivating counterexample: it credited the Coop
vault without debiting the staking vault. Counting the ledgers in the sum would make the theorem false,
not stronger.
-/

namespace Rchain

/-- A validator's claim on the staking vault: the bond escrowed out of the pool, and the block at which it
    may be paid (`Withdrawal`, `native_state.rs:389-404`). The struct stores the **bond only** — the

    epoch it left in. -/

/-- A delegation (law 57): `amount` of a delegator's principal attributed to an operator's key
    (`pos:delegations`, `rholang/src/native_state.rs`). The port's record shape is exactly this triple,
    which is why the accrued-reward leaf (`pos:delegated_rewards`) reuses it — the same three fields,
    read as a credit rather than a principal. -/

/-- The PoS state: the three coin fields, the eight ledgers, the active set, and the two parameters the
    transition reads.

    `user` is the **total** over every user vault rather than a map: every transfer in this mechanism
    either moves coins between the staking vault and a user's vault or between the staking and Coop
    vaults, so the total is what conservation is about and a per-address map would only add lookup
    lemmas. `active` is what step 4 recomputes; `pool` is the bond pool (`pos:bonds`), which a bond joins
    immediately but which the active set only follows at a boundary. -/

      selected**, because that is what the port's leaf holds: a `BTreeMap<Validator, NonNegI64>` with
      stakes (`native_state.rs:796-798`), written by `select_active` at a boundary (`:1312-1317`), by
      genesis (`:1061`) and by `slash` (`:1429`). It is deliberately **not** a view of `pool`: between
      boundaries the pool's stakes move and this one does not, which is law 44's own gate seen from the

  /-- Delegated principals (`pos:delegations`, law 57): a third party's stake attributed to an operator's
      key. The principal itself is **not** here rather than in `pool` — `pool` carries the aggregate — so
      this ledger is the attribution, not a second copy of the stake. -/

/-- **The epoch divisor**: `max(epoch_length, 1)` (`epoch_divisor`, `native_state.rs:632-647`). The
    contract divides by `$$epochLength$$` directly and faults on zero; the port reads a zero as "every
    block is a boundary", which is what `epoch_length = 1` means to the contract. -/
def divisor (s : PosState) : Nat := max s.epochLength 1

/-- **The gate** (`is_epoch_boundary`, `native_state.rs:649-653`): an epoch runs exactly when the block
    number is a multiple of the divisor. -/
def isBoundary (s : PosState) (n : Nat) : Bool := n % divisor s == 0

  s.quarantineLength + s.epochLength * (1 + n / divisor s)

/-- **The withdrawal request** (`withdraw`, `native_state.rs:1151-1189`): the request records a deadline
    and changes **nothing else** — the validator stays in the pool and in the active set, still earning.
    This is law 47's first stage. -/
def stage (s : PosState) (v : Validator) (n : Nat) : PosState :=
  { s with requests := ⟨v, withdrawDeadline s n⟩ :: s.requests }

/-- **A bond** (`bond`, `native_state.rs:1074-1149`): the stake moves from the user's vault into the
    staking vault and the validator joins the **pool** — and the active set is untouched. Activation is
    the boundary's step 4, which is law 44's "pooled but not activated". -/
def bond (s : PosState) (v : Validator) (stake : Nat) : PosState :=
  { s with user := s.user - stake, vault := s.vault + stake, pool := (v, stake) :: s.pool }

/-- Step 1 of `close_block`: the epoch's rewards are written into the **committed** ledger
    (`native_state.rs:1253-1266`). The amounts are `Rchain.reward`'s (modelled above); the machine takes
    them as given, because no amount moves a coin — and *that* is what conservation claims. -/

      (fun (l : List (Validator × Nat)) (wb : Validator × Nat) =>
        setKey l wb.1 (lookup l wb.1 + r wb.1)) s.committed }

/-- Step 2: every staged request becomes an escrowed claim — its bond leaves the pool and its deadline is
    recorded (`native_state.rs:1268-1279`). No coin moves: the escrowed bond is still in the vault and the
    validator's own vault is still empty. Law 47's second stage. -/
def movePending (s : PosState) : PosState :=
  { s with
    claims := s.claims ++ s.requests.filterMap (fun r =>
      match s.pool.find? (fun wb => wb.1 = r.who) with
      | some wb => some ⟨r.who, wb.2, r.deadline⟩
      | none => none),
    pool := s.pool.filter (fun wb => !(s.requests.any (fun r => r.who = wb.1))),
    requests := [] }

/-- The claims a boundary pays: those whose quarantine has elapsed (`native_state.rs:1281-1285`, the
    filter `w.deadline <= block_number`). -/
def dueClaims (s : PosState) (n : Nat) : List PosClaim := s.claims.filter (fun c => c.deadline ≤ n)

/-- What one claim is paid: its bond **plus** its committed reward, read from the ledger at payment time

    `Pos.rhox:604`). -/

/-- The total a boundary pays out. -/
def duePayout (s : PosState) (n : Nat) : Nat := nsum ((dueClaims s n).map (payoutOf s))

/-- Step 3: pay every due claim — debit the staking vault, credit the validator's vault, remove the claim
    and its committed entry (`native_state.rs:1286-1302`). Written as one batch rather than a fold, which
    is the same function whenever a validator has at most one claim: the port's `withdrawers` is a *map*,
    so that is an invariant of the mechanism rather than a coincidence.

    **`none` is the port's refusal, not a silent half-payment.** `debit_pos_vault` returns an error when
    the vault cannot cover the transfer and `close_block` propagates it, having persisted nothing (its
    writes come after all four steps, `native_state.rs:1313-1317`). An unguarded `Nat` subtraction would
    instead truncate the debit and *mint* the difference — a model that quietly does the wrong thing,
    which is the failure mode this project's Rust avoids structurally and its models are supposed to as
    well. So the payment is partial on purpose, and the conservation theorem below carries no hypothesis:
    it is stated about whatever the step returned. -/
def payDue (s : PosState) (n : Nat) : Option PosState :=
  if duePayout s n ≤ s.vault then
    some { s with

      committed := s.committed.filter (fun p => !((dueClaims s n).any (fun c => c.who = p.1))) }
  else none

/-- Step 4: the active set for the epoch that starts now — the pool's members **with their stakes**,
    minus anyone whose bond is escrowed in a claim (`select_active`, `native_state.rs:558-618`). The
    stakes are kept rather than dropped: this is the `pos:active` map the finalizer's gates read, and a
    bond that arrives between boundaries must not move it (law 44, and AUDIT C92's finding). -/
def reselect (s : PosState) : PosState :=

/-- **The epoch transition**, in `close_block`'s order (`native_state.rs:1219-1354`): commit the rewards,
    move the staged withdrawals into claims, pay the claims whose quarantine elapsed, re-select the active
    set. The gate is *outside* this function (`closeBlock`), because a transition that branched on it
    would make "off a boundary nothing changes" a restatement of its own definition. -/
def epochStep (r : Validator → Nat) (s : PosState) (n : Nat) : Option PosState :=

    stores the **bond only** (the contract stores `allBonds.get(pk)` at `Pos.rhox:582` and adds
    `committedRewards` at `:604`, which is the order the port keeps). -/

/-- **Law 44 — and the boundary is what activates it.** Step 4 makes the pool — the newly bonded
    validator included, **with the stakes it holds at this boundary** — the active set, minus anyone
    whose bond is escrowed in a claim; so a bond and a boundary in the same block do activate it. This is
    the port's `bond_escrows_the_stake_and_activates_at_the_boundary` in the model.

    **The statement is unconditional now, and that is the stakes' doing.** It used to assume
    `s'.claims = []` because the active set was a list of *ids*: `s'.pool.map (·.1)` could only equal
    step 4's output when the filter removed nobody. Carrying the stakes makes the conclusion *the
    filter itself*, so the hypothesis has nothing left to do — the escrowed-claim case is the same
    theorem with a non-empty claim list, which is strictly more than the no-claim instance the port's
    test exercises. The old hypothesis is not weaker, it is inert. -/

/-- **The ordering the release rule depends on**: the move of step 2 leaves the committed ledger
    exactly as step 1 wrote it, so a validator that leaves the pool at this boundary is still paid
    against a reward committed for the epoch it was in. The two steps are ordered commit-then-move in

    commitment is dropped, reordered after the move, or keyed to the wrong validator. (The general form
    of this — for any pool and any reward function — is a `foldl` induction over `setKey` and is owed;
    this is the instance the port's test exercises, decided rather than described.) -/

/-! ## The slash, graded by the offence (AUDIT C199)

The transitions above are the port's `close_block`. This section is the port's `slash`, and it is here
because it is the other half of what a validator's stake is exposed to: the epoch says what a validator
*earns*, and this says what it can **lose**.

**Before C199 the model had no slash at all**, which is why the rule could be argued in prose for as long
as it was: the port took the whole bond, the register recorded that it did, and nothing here could state
that a *bounded* loss was even a thing to ask for. The bound is now a theorem, and so is the property
that keeps the offender's balance from shrinking the pot for everyone else (C197). -/

/-- What a validator holds in the PoS system: its **bond**, its **accrued and unwithdrawn rewards**, and
    an **escrowed claim**. The staking vault holds all three, and the port's `slash` clears all three.

    **Delegated stake enters this sum exactly once, and through `pool`.** A delegation's principal is
    *inside* the operator's aggregate `pool` entry — that is what "aggregate" means — so the ledger
    `s.delegations` is deliberately **not** added here: doing so would count a delegator's REV twice and
    overstate what a slash may take. What *is* added is the two delegated holdings that have left the
    pool or never joined it: a delegator's accrued reward (`pos:delegated_rewards`, which is a credit
    against the vault that `committed` does not carry) and an escrowed undelegated principal
    (`pos:delegation_claims`, out of the pool until its deadline passes, like `claims`). -/

/-! ## The block's producer is paid for the work (B2)

The transitions above say what a validator earns *for being drawn*; `slash` says what it can lose.
Neither says anything about **producing a block**, which is the work the protocol actually needs: a
drawn validator earns its share of the epoch pot whether it proposes or not, and a validator that
never proposes is, in the port's own words, "a drag instead".

This is the one production signal the protocol can read without new state — a block's **own signed
sender**. Every deploy's burned phlo passes through the staking vault on its way to the epoch pot
(`pre_charge` in, `refund` out), so paying a share of what was burned to the address that signed the
block which burned it is a transfer inside that same vault. It needs no participation score, no new
leaf, and it cannot be steered by anyone but the signer. -/

/-- The share of a deploy's burned phlo paid to the block's producer
    (`PosParams::executor_share`; 2 500 = a quarter, the shipped default). -/
def executorShare : Nat := 2500

/-- **Pay the block's producer** (`native_state.rs`'s `pay_executor`): `burned * executorShare /

    set and every ledger are untouched — this moves income, never stake. -/

  { s with vault := s.vault - burned * executorShare / 10000,

/-! ## The absence rule (B4)

The epoch pays for *being drawn*; `payExecutor` pays for *producing*. Neither says anything about a
validator that is drawn and produces nothing — which, on this protocol, is free: an absent validator
keeps its bond, counts in the finality denominator, and until this rule existed collected its share of
the pot.

The rule is stated here as what it is: **a function of an epoch's reward and of how long the validator
has been silent**, and of nothing else. That is the whole of "income only, never the bond" — it cannot
reach a stake because a stake is not one of its arguments. -/

/-- **The participation weight**: basis points of a drawn validator's epoch share that it is paid, as a
    function of how far behind the last finalised fringe its latest message sits.

    `grace` is the lag inside which the weight is the whole share, `knee` the lag at which it reaches
    zero, and the ramp between is linear. **Two parameters rather than one, and that is a property rather
    than a taste**: a rule that pays an honest validator *in full* and reaches zero elsewhere cannot be a
    function of a single threshold, because the ramp would have to begin at lag zero — which puts a
    haircut on every live validator, including one that missed nothing. `grace = knee` reproduces a
    binary threshold rule exactly, so this is the general case and the cliff is its instance. -/
def participationWeight (behind grace knee : Nat) : Nat :=
  if behind ≤ grace then 10000
  else if knee ≤ behind then 0

    through the rule: every adjusted share is bounded by the share it adjusts, so an epoch under this
    rule still cannot pay out more than its pot. -/

/-- **And it reaches zero at the knee** — the weight is a penalty with a floor, not a curve that
    asymptotes: past the knee a validator is paid nothing for the epoch it sat out.

    **`grace < behind` is not decoration**: it rules out the full-share branch, and without it the
    statement is false — `participationWeight 5 10 5` is `10000`, not `0`, because a knee below the
    grace is a shape the first branch already answers. So the statement is about the *graded* shape,

    share. The hypotheses are each load-bearing — drop `knee ≠ 0` and the off switch returns the reward

/-- **An epoch under the participation rule still cannot pay out more than its pot** — the composition
    `sum_rewards_le_pot` could not state on its own, because the rule's effect is a per-validator
    scaling that happens *after* the split. It is the clause of #150's close condition that reads "the
    invariant must survive whatever replaces the formula": the split is unchanged and still bounded by
    the pot, and the rule only ever multiplies each of its outputs by something at most the whole, so
    the scaled total is bounded by the total.

    The two hypotheses are the ones the weight supplies: `hw` is `participationWeight_le` at every
    drawn validator, and the other two are `sum_rewards_le_pot`'s own. -/

/-- **The ramp is a ramp, decided rather than described.** Four points across the weight's four regions —
    inside the grace, two places on the interior, at the knee and past it — so an implementation that
    ignored the ramp, or the grace, or the knee fails on a computation. A fixture whose weights are all
    equal is the degeneracy AUDIT C149 recorded in this file once already.

    **This is not a companion to `absence_withholds`; it is what makes it bite.** That theorem is an
    implication whose hypothesis is `participationWeight behind grace knee < 10000`, so a weight that was
    *always* `10000` satisfies it **vacuously** — and that is measured rather than argued: replacing the
    weight with the constant `10000` leaves the implication's truth untouched and fails *this*
    declaration, with `decide` reporting that the proposition is false. The implication and the instance
    are therefore a pair, and neither alone is a check. It is the same trap as the absence rule's own,
    one level up: there the theorems were satisfied by a rule that withheld nothing, here by a weight
    that never withholds. -/

/-! ## Delegated stake (law 57)

Every section above assumes the stake a key carries is the operator's own. This one models the case the
protocol could not previously express: a **delegator** — a key that holds REV, signs its own deploys, and
has no intention of running a node — bonding that REV *through* an operator's key and holding a claim on
what it earns.

The port's shape is one substitution and four ledgers. The substitution is `pos:bonds`: a key's entry
becomes the **aggregate**, the operator's own stake plus every delegation to it, which is exactly what
`delegate` below writes and why `atRisk` reads it without adding `s.delegations` a second time. The
ledgers are `pos:delegations` (who owns what, modelled as `PosDelegation`), `pos:pending_delegations` (a
staged exit), `pos:delegation_claims` (the escrow it becomes) and `pos:delegated_rewards` (a delegator's
accrued share of an epoch, which must not sit in the operator's `committed` map where the operator could
be paid it).

**What this section can and cannot say, and why.** `PosState.user` is the *total* over every user vault
rather than a map — the state's own doc gives the reason, and the withdrawal path already carries the
same simplification. So the arithmetic below pins **how much** a delegator is owed and
`delegate_conserves` pins that no coin is minted, but no theorem here can say *which* vault was credited;
`fanOut`'s per-vault attribution is the Rust's, and it is pinned by a Rust witness rather than restated
here. What is *not* deferred is the part a map is not needed for: that the split of one validator's reward
is **exact** (so a validator with delegators commits the same total it would have alone, and law 46 is not
weakened), that it is the **identity** when nobody has delegated (so a chain that never delegates writes
the state it wrote before this law existed), and that a second delegation from the same delegator adds to
the first rather than replacing it. -/

/-- The principal one operator's key carries on behalf of others — the sum the port's `pos:delegations`
    lookup returns for one operator, and the amount that must already be inside its `pos:bonds` entry.
    Written as a recursion rather than a `foldl` so that the two cons cases below are `simp`, which is
    what makes "a second delegation accumulates" a computation instead of an induction. -/
def delegatedTotal : List PosDelegation → Validator → Nat
  | [], _ => 0
  | d :: rest, op => (if d.operator = op then d.amount else 0) + delegatedTotal rest op

/-- **A second delegation from the same delegator adds to the first.** The port inserts into
    `pos:delegations` with `lookup k + amount`, so a delegator's principal is the **sum** of its
    transfers and not its last one; the model keeps two records and this says the totals agree. Without
    it an implementation that *replaced* the entry would satisfy every pro-rata theorem above, because
    those read a list of amounts and cannot see whether two of them should have been one. -/

/-- **The total is one operator's, and no other's.** Two delegators of the same operator sum; a third

    computed over the whole ledger instead of one key would produce. -/

/-- **The pro-rata split, with the base that is divided by but not paid.** `amount` is divided across
    `weights` in order; `base` joins the **denominator** without being issued a share. Both halves of
    delegated stake are this function: the reward split has `base` the operator's own stake (it is paid,
    but as the remainder rather than by this formula — see `split_sums_to_the_reward`), and the slash's
    refund has `base = 0`, the principals being the whole of what was at risk. One floor per share, so the
    shares sum to at most `amount` and the difference is the dust the operator keeps. -/

    makes every share zero. -/

/-- **The split is exact.** The delegators' shares plus the operator's remainder are the reward the key
    was paid — so a validator with delegators commits the same total it would have committed alone, and

    survives it rather than needing to be restated. -/

/-- **Dormancy, stated in the model.** With no delegators the split issues no share at all and the
    operator's remainder is the whole reward — so a chain where `delegate` has never been called writes
    the same `pos:committed` entry it wrote before this law existed. This is the arithmetic half of the
    port's byte-identical-post-state requirement; the store half is that the four new leaves are left
    **absent** rather than written empty. -/

  simp [proRata, nsum]

/-- **The shares are proportional, and the dust is real — decided, not described.** The first clause is
    the reward split: a reward of 100 on an operator holding 30 with principals 10 and 61 divides by 101
    and pays 9 and 60, leaving 31 to the operator — the floor bites, the two shares **differ** from each
    other and from zero, and the operator's remainder is neither the whole reward nor nothing. The second
    is the refund, where `base = 0` and the principals are the whole denominator, so 100 over `[30, 70]`
    is exact. The third keeps a non-zero base with a denominator that does not divide.

    **The fixture is the point, and it was measured rather than argued** (AUDIT C149, three times in this
    file now). Three plausible wrong splits were compiled against these clauses: the operator keeps
    everything (`weights.map (fun _ => 0)`), every delegator gets an equal share
    (`weights.map (fun _ => amount / (base + weights.length))`), and the base is dropped from the
    denominator (`weights.map (fun w => amount * w / nsum weights)`). All three are refuted by the first
    and third clauses. **The second clause refutes none of them and is not meant to** — it is the exact
    end of the range, included to show the dust is not always present, and with `base = 0` it cannot tell
    a rule that divides by the base from one that ignores it, which is the base-drop mutant's own
    degenerate case. **The third clause read `[1, 1, 1]` when it was written, and that was nearly vacuous
    for the same reason**: three equal weights pay `100 / 3` each under the real rule *and* under the
    equal-share mutant, so it distinguished nothing that the first clause did not. `[1, 2]` with base 40
    gives `[2, 4]`, which the equal-share mutant reads as `[2, 2]` and the base-drop mutant as `[33, 66]`.
    A fixture clause that no plausible mutant fails is a clause that is not a check. -/

/-- **A delegation** (`delegate`, `rholang/src/native_state.rs`): the principal leaves the delegator's own
    vault and joins the **staking vault**, and the operator's pool entry becomes the **aggregate** — which
    is the whole of what a delegation changes for consensus, since `compute_bonds` reads the active set
    that `select_active` draws from the pool. It activates exactly as `bond` does: the pool follows at
    once and `active` only at the boundary, so a delegation cannot conjure a slot mid-epoch.

    The principal is **not** recorded in `pool` a second time; the ledger records who owns the part that
    is there, which is why `atRisk` reads the pool entry without adding this ledger. -/
